# Genetic Algorithm for Radar Deployment Optimization

This project implements a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to optimize the deployment of radars, aiming to maximize coverage while minimizing resource usage. The solution is visualized and evaluated through the **Command Line Interface (CLI)**.

## Features:
- **Optimization**: Genetic Algorithm to optimize radar placement.
- **Interactive Visualization**: View radar deployment and coverage.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Modify GA settings (population size, number of generations, radar range).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   cd RadarDeploymentOptimizer_with_GA_algo
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
